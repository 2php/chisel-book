\title{Digital Design with Chisel}

\author{Martin Schoeberl}

\maketitle \thispagestyle{empty}

These lecture notes, which shall become a book, are an introduction into digital design with the focus
on using the hardware construction language
\myref{https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/}{Chisel}. The approach of this book
is to present small to medium sized typical hardware components to explore
hardware design with Chisel.
We will walk through these examples in detail.

\tableofcontents

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This book is an introduction to digital system design using a modern hardware
construction language, \myref{https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/}{Chisel}~\cite{chisel:dac2012}.
In this book, we focus on a higher abstraction level than usual in digital design,
to enable to build more complex, interacting digital systems in a shorter time.

This book and Chisel is targeting two groups of developers:
(1) hardware designers fluid in VHDL or Verilog using other languages such as Python,
Java, or TCL/TK to generate hardware to move to a single hardware construction language
where hardware generation is part of the language and
(2) software programmers who are becoming interested in hardware design,
e.g., as future chips from Intel will include programmable hardware to speed up programs.

\todo{Why Chisel}

Hardware is now commonly described with a hardware description language.
The time of drawing hardware components, even with CAD tools, is definitely
over. Some high-level schematics can give an overview of the system but are
not intended to describe the system.

The two most common hardware description languages are Verilog and VHDL.
Both languages are old, contain a lot of legacies, and have a moving line of what
constructions of the language are synthesizable to hardware.
Do not get me wrong: VHDL and Verilog are perfectly able to describe a hardware
block that can be synthesized in an
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit}{ASIC}.
For hardware design in Chisel, Verilog serves as an intermediate language
for testing and synthesis.

This book is not a general introduction to hardware design and the fundamentals of it.
For an introduction of basics, such as how to build a gate out of CMOS transistors,
refer to other digital design books.
However, the intention of this book is to teach digital design at an abstraction level that is
current practice to describe ASICs or designs targeting
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array}{FPGA}s.\footnote{As the author is more familiar with FPGAs
than ASICs as target technology, some design optimizations shown in this book are
targeting FPGA technology.}
As prerequisites for this book we assume basic knowledge of
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra}{Boolean algebra} and the
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number}{binary number system}.
Furthermore, some programming experience in any programming language
is assumed. No knowledge of Verilog or VHDL is needed.
Chisel can be and shall be, your first programming language to describe digital hardware.
As the build process in the examples is based on \code{sbt} and \code{make}
basic knowledge of the command line interface (CLI, also called terminal or
Unix shell) will be helpful.

\todo{Think about: Chisel is not a large (big?) language, but this is good for hardware description. The basic constructs can be learned/ fit on a page.... The power of the Chisel ecosystem comes from being embedded in Scala when programming hardware generators.
Check also Rust book for structure, but better the Scala book.}

Chisel itself is not a big language, as it shall be for hardware design.
Therefore, this book is not a big book as well.
Chisel is for sure smaller than VHDL and Verilog, which carry a lot of legacies.
The power of Chisel comes from the embedding of Chisel within
\myref{https://www.scala-lang.org/}{Scala}, which is itself an expressive language.
However, Scala is not the topic
of this book. We provide a short section on Scala for hardware designers,
but a general introduction to Scala is better served by the textbook by
Odersky et al.~\cite{Scala}.

This book is a tutorial in digital design and the Chisel language, it is not
a Chisel language reference nor is it a book on complete chip design.


All code examples shown in this book are extracted from complete programs
that have been compiled and tested. Therefore, the code shall not contain
any syntax errors. The code examples are available from the
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-book}{GitHub repository}
of this book.
Besides showing Chisel code, we have also tried to show useful designs and
principles of good hardware description style.

This book is optimized for reading on a laptop or on a tablet (e.g., an iPad).
We include links to further reading in the running text, mostly to
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/}{Wikipedia} articles.

\section{Installing Chisel and FPGA Tools}

Chisel is a Scala library and the easiest way to install Chisel and Scala is
with \code{sbt}, the Scala build tool.

On Mac OS X, with the packet manager \myref{https://brew.sh/}{Homebrew},
\code{sbt} is installed with:

\begin{verbatim}
$ brew install sbt
\end{verbatim}

\noindent For Ubuntu, which is based on Debian, software is usually installed from a
Debian file (.deb). However, as of the time of this writing \code{sbt} is not
available as a ready to install package. Therefore, the installation process
is a little bit more involved:
\begin{verbatim}
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | \
  sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 \
  --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
\end{verbatim}



Chisel and Scala can also be installed and used under Windows.
For instructions see:
\myref{https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html}{Installing sbt on Windows}.
\todo{Test Windows version}

To build hardware for an FPGA you need a synthesize tool. The two major
FPGA vendors, Intel\footnote{former Altera} and Xilinx, provide free versions of
their tools that cover small to medium sized FPGAs. Those medium sized
FPGAs are large enough to build multicore RISC style processors.
Intel provides the \myref{https://www.altera.com/products/design-software/fpga-design/quartus-prime/download.html}{Quartus Prime Lite Edition} and Xilinx the
\myref{https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/vivado-webpack.html}{Vivado Design Suite, WebPACK Edition}.

\section{Hello World}

Each book on a programming language shall start with a minimal example,
called the \emph{Hello World} example. Following code is a first approach:


\lstinputlisting[language=chisel]{src/main/scala/HelloScala.scala}


\noindent Compiling and executing this short program with \code{sbt}

\begin{chisel}
$ sbt "runMain HelloScala"
\end{chisel}

\noindent leads to the expected output of a Hello World program:

\begin{chisel}
[info] Running HelloScala
Hello Chisel World!
\end{chisel}

\noindent However, is this Chisel? Is this hardware generated to print a string?
No, this is actually plain Scala code and not a representative Hello World
program for a hardware design.

\section{Chisel Hello World}

What is then the equivalent of a Hello World program for a hardware design?
The minimal useful and visible design? A blinking LED is the hardware (or even
embedded software) version of Hello World. If a LED blinks, we are ready to
solve bigger problems!


\begin{figure}
\input{code/hello.txt}
\caption{A hardware Hello World in Chisel}
\label{fig:chisel:hello}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:chisel:hello} shows a blinking LED, described in Chisel.
It is not important that you understand the details of this code example.
We will cover those in the following chapters. Just note that the circuit is
usually clocked with a high frequency, e.g., 50 MHz, and we need a counter
to derive timing in the Hz range to achieve a visible blinking. In the above
example we count from 0 up to 25000000-1 and then toggle the blinking signal
(\code{blkReg := \textasciitilde blkReg}) and restart the counter (\code{cntReg := 0.U}).
That hardware then blinks the LED at 1~Hz.

\section{An IDE for Chisel}

This book makes no assumptions about your programming environment or editor to use.
Learning of the basics should be easy with just using \code{sbt} at the command line
and an editor of your choice. In the tradition of other books, all commands that you
shall type in a shell/terminal/CLI are preceded by a \code{\$} character, which you
shall not type in. As example here the Unix \code{ls} command, which lists files of
the current folder:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ls
\end{verbatim}

That said, an integrated development environment (IDE) with a compiler running in
the background can speedup coding. As Chisel is basically a Scala library, all IDEs
that support Scala are also good IDEs for Chisel.
It is possible in \myref{https://www.eclipse.org/}{Eclipse} and
\myref{https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html}{IntelliJ}
to generate a project from the sbt project configuration in \code{build.sbt}.
You can create an Eclipse project via
\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt eclipse
\end{verbatim}
and import that project in Eclipse.
In IntelliJ you can create a new project from existing sources and then select from \code{build.sbt}.

\section{Source Access}

This book is open source and hosted at GitHub: \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-book}{chisel-book}.
Small Chisel code snippets are included in the repository of the book.
Larger examples are collected in the accompanying repository \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}. If you find an error or typo in the book, a GitHub pull request is the most convenient way
to incorporate your improvement.

\end{itemize}

\section{Exercises}

Each chapter ends with hands-on exercises. For the introduction exercise we will use an
FPGA board to get one LED blinking.
As a first step clone (or fork) the \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}
repository from GitHub.
The Hello World example is in its own folder \code{hello-world}, setup as
a minimal project. You can explore the Chisel code of the blinking LED
in \code{Hello.scala}.
Compile the blinking LED with following steps:

\begin{chisel}
$ git clone https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples.git
$ cd chisel-examples/hello-world/
$ make
\end{chisel}

After some initial downloading of Chisel components, this will produce the Verilog file \code{Hello.v}.
Explore this Verilog file. You will see that it contains two inputs \code{clock} and \code{reset}
and one output \code{io\_led}. When you compare this Verilog file with the Chisel module
you will notice that the Chisel module does not contain \code{clock} or \code{reset}.
Those signals are implicitly generated and in most designs it is convenient to not need to
deal with these low-level details. Chisel provides register components and those
are connected automatically to \code{clock} and \code{reset} (if needed).


We also provide an additional Verilog top level in \code{verilog/hello\_top.v},
which can be used to avoid connecting a reset signal (as FPGA registers usually
are set to 0 on FPGA configuration).

The next step is to setup an FPGA project file for the synthesize tool, assign the pins,
and compile\footnote{The real process is more elaborated with following steps: synthesizing the logic,
performing place and route, performing timing analysis, and generating a bitfile.
However, for the purpose of this introduction example we simply call it ``compile''
your code.} the Verilog code, and configure the FPGA with the resulting bitfile.
We cannot provide the details of these steps. Please consult the manual of
your Intel Quartus or Xilinx Vivado tool.
However, the examples repository contains some ready to use Quartus
projects in folder \code{quartus} for several popular FPGA boards (e.g., DE2-115).
If it happens that the repository contains support for your board, start Quartus, open the project,
compile it by pressing the \emph{Play} button, and configure the FPGA board
with the \emph{Programmer} button and one of the LEDs should blink.

{\bf Gratulation! You managed to get your first design in Chisel running in an FPGA!}

Now change the blinking frequency to a slower or a faster value and
rerun the build process. Blinking frequencies and also blinking patterns
communicate different ``emotions''. E.g., a slow blinking LED signals that
everything is ok, a fast blinking LED signals an alarm state.
Explore which frequencies express best those two different emotions.

As a more challenging extension to the exercise, generate following blinking pattern:
the LED shall be on for 200~ms every second. For this pattern, you might
decouple the change of the LED blinking from the counter reset.
You will need a second constant where you change the state of the
\code{blkReg} register. What kind of emotion does this pattern produce?
Is it alarming or more like a sign of live signal?




\chapter{Basic Circuits}

In this section we introduce the basic components for digital design,
combinational circuits and flip-flops.
These essential elements can be combined to build larger, more interesting circuits.

\section{Signal Types and Constants}

Chisel provides three data types to describe signals, combinational logic, and registers:
\code{Bits}, \code{UInt}, and \code{SInt}. \code{UInt} and \code{SInt} extend \code{Bits}
and all three types represent a vector of bits. \code{UInt} gives this vector of
bits the meaning of an unsigned integer and \code{SInt} of a signed
integer.\footnote{The type \codefoot{Bits} in the current version of Chisel is missing operations and
therefore not very useful for user code.}
Chisel uses \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\%27s\_complement}{two's complement}
as signed integer representation.
Here is the definition different types, an 8-bit \code{Bits}, 8-bit unsigned integer, and an 10-bit
signed integer:

\input{code/types.txt}

\noindent The width of a vector of bits is defined by a Chisel width type (\code{Width}).
The following expression casts the Scala integer \code{n} to a Chisel width,
which is used for the definition of the \code{Bits} vector:

\input{code/n_w.txt}

\noindent Constants can be defined by using a Scala integer and converting it to a Chisel type:

\input{code/constants.txt}

\noindent Constants can also be defined with a width, by using the Chisel width type:

\input{code/const_width.txt}

\noindent When you find the notion of 8.U and 4.W a little bit funny, consider it as a variant of an integer
constant with a type. This notation is similar to 8L, representing a long integer constant in C, Java, and Scala.

Chisel benefits from Scala's type inference and in many places type information can be left out.
The same is also valid for bit widths. In many cases, Chisel will automatically infer the correct width.
Therefore, a Chisel description of hardware is more concise and better readable than VHDL or
Verilog.

For constants defined in other bases than decimal, the constant is defined in a string with
a preceding \code{h} for hexadecimal (base 16), \code{o} for octal (base 8), and \code{b}
for binary (base 2). The following example shows the definition of constant 255 in different
bases. In this example we omit the bit width and Chisel infers the minimum width to fit
the constants in, in this case 8 bits.

\input{code/const_base.txt}

\noindent The above code also shows how to use an underscore to group digits in the
string that represents a constant. The underscore is simply ignored.

To represent logic values, Chisel defines the type \code{Bool}.
\code{Bool} can represent a \emph{true} or \emph{false} value.
the following code shows the definition of type \code{Bool} and the definition of
\code{Bool} constants, by converting the Scala Boolean constants \code{true}
and \code{false} to Chisel \code{Bool} constants.

\input{code/bool.txt}


\section{Combinational Circuits}

Chisel uses \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra}{Boolean algebra} operators,
as they are defined in C, Java, Scala, and probably several other programming languages,
to described combinational circuits.
Following line of code defines a circuit that combines signals \code{a} and \code{b} with \emph{and}
gates and combines the result with signal \code{c} with \emph{or} gates.

\input{code/logic.txt}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/logic}
  \caption{Logic for the expression \code{a \& b | c}.
  The wires can be single bit or multiple bits. The Chisel expression, and the schematics, are the same.}
  \label{fig:logic}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:logic} shows the schematic of this combinatorial expression.
Note that this circuit may be for a vector of bits and not only single wires
that are combined with the AND and OR circuits.

In this example we do not define the type nor the width of signal \code{logic}.
Both are inferred from the type and width of the expression.
The standard logic operations in Chisel are:

\input{code/bool_ops.txt}

\noindent The arithmetic operations use the standard operators:

\input{code/arith_ops.txt}

\noindent The resulting width of the operation is the maximum width of the operators for
addition and subtraction, the sum of the two widths for the multiplication, and usually
the width of the numerator for divide and modulo operations.\footnote{The exact
details are available in the \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl/blob/master/spec/spec.pdf}{FIRRTL specification}.}



The full list of operators can be found at
\myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/wiki/Builtin-Operators}{builtin operators}.

\subsection{Multiplexer}

A \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer}{multiplexer} is a circuit that selects between alternatives.
In the most basic form it selects between two alternatives. Figure~\ref{fig:mux} shows
such a 2:1 multiplexer, or mux for short. Depending on the value of the
select signal (\code{sel}) signal \code{y} will represent signal \code{a} or
signale \code{b}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/mux}
  \caption{A basic 2:1 multiplexor.}
  \label{fig:mux}
\end{figure}

A multiplexer can be simply built from logic.
However, as multiplexing  is such a common operation, Chisel provides a multiplexer,

\input{code/mux.txt}

\noindent where \code{a} is selected when the \code{sel} is \code{true.B}, otherwise \code{b}
is selected. The type of \code{sel} is a Chisel \code{Bool}; the inputs \code{a} and \code{b}
can be any Chisel base type or aggregate (bundles or vectors) as long as they are the same
type.

With logical and arithmetical operations and a multiplexer, every combinational
circuit can be described. However, Chisel provides further components and control abstractions
for a more elegant description of a combinational circuit, which are described lateer.

The second basic component needed to describe a digital circuit is a state element,
also called register, which is described next.



\section{Register for State}

Chisel provides a register, which is a collection of
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop\_(electronics)\#D\_flip-flop}{D flip-flops}.
The register is implicitly connected to a global clock and is updated on the rising edge.
When an initialization value is provided at the declaration of the register,
it uses a synchronous reset connected to a global reset signal.
A register can be any Chisel type that can be represented as a collection of bits.
Following code defines an 8-bit register, initialized with 0 at reset:

\input{code/register.txt}

\noindent An input is connected to the register with the \code{:=} update operator and
the output of the register can be used just with the name in an expression:

\input{code/reg_con.txt}

\noindent A register can also be connected to its input at the definition:

\input{code/reg_next.txt}

\noindent A register can also be connected to its input and a constant as
initial value at the definition:

\input{code/reg_both.txt}

\noindent To distinguish from signals representing combinational logic and registers,
a common practice is to prefix register names with \code{reg}.
Another common practice, coming from Java and Scala, is to use
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case}{camelCase} for
identifier consisting of several words. The convention is to start
functions and variables with a lower case and classes (types) with
an upper case.

\subsection{Counting}

Counting is a very basic operation in digital systems. On might count events.
However, more often counting is used to define a time interval. Counting the
clock cycles and triggering an action when the time interval has expired.

A simple approach is counting up to a value. However, in computer science,
and in digital design, counting starts at 0. Therefore, if we want to count till
10 we count from 0 to 9. The following code shows such a counter that counts
till 9 and wraps around to 0 when reaching 9.

If we want to count N, we start with 0 and count till N-1.

\input{code/counter.txt}





\section{Exercises}

In the introduction you implemented a blinking LED on an FPGA board
(from \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}), which is a reasonable
hardware \emph{Hello World} example. It used only internal state, a single LED output, and no input.
Copy that project into a new folder and extend it by adding some inputs to the \code{io} \code{Bundle}
with \code{val sw = Input(UInt(2.W))}.

\input{code/basic_exercise.txt}

\noindent For those switches, you also need to assign the PIN names for the FPGA board.
You can find examples of pin assignments in the Quartus project files of the ALU project
(e.g., for the \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/quartus/altde2-115/alu.qsf}{DE2-115
FPGA board}).

When you have defined those inputs and the pin assignment, start with a simple test:
drop all blinking logic from the design and connect one switch to the LED output;
compile and configure the FPGA device. Can you switch the LED on an off with the switch?
If yes, you have now inputs available. If not, you need to debug your FPGA configuration.
This can also be done with the GUI version of the tool.

Now use two switches and implement one of the basic combinational functions,
e.g., AND two switches and show the result on the LED. Change the function.
The next step involves three input switches to implement a multiplexer: one acts as
select signal and the other two are the two inputs for the 2:1 multiplexer.

Now you have been able to implement simple combinational functions and test them
in real hardware in an FPGA. As a next step, we will take a first look at how the build
process works to generate an FPGA configuration. Furthermore, we will also
explore a simple testing framework from Chisel, which allows you to test circuits
without configuring an FPGA and toggle switches.

\chapter{Build Process and Testing}

To get started with more interesting Chisel code we first need to learn how to compile
Chisel programs, how to generate Verilog code for execution in an FPGA, and how
to write tests for debugging and to verify that our circuits are correct.

Chisel is written in Scala, so any build process that supports Scala is possible
with a Chisel project. One popular build tool for Scala is \myref{https://www.scala-sbt.org/}{sbt},
which stands for Scala interactive build tool.
Besides driving the build and test process, \code{sbt} also downloads the correct
version of Scala and the Chisel libraries.

\section{Building your Project with sbt}

The Scala library that represents Chisel and the Chisel testers are automatically
downloaded during the build process from a Maven repository.
The libraries are referenced by \code{build.sbt}. It is possible to configure \code{build.sbt}
with \code{latest.release} to always use the most actual version of Chisel.
However, this means on each build the version is looked up from the Maven
repository. This lookup needs an Internet connection for the build to succeed.
Better use a dedicated version of Chisel and all other Scala libraries in your \code{build.sbt}.
Maybe sometimes it is also good to be able to write hardware code and test it without an Internet connection.
For example, it is cool to do hardware design on a plane.

\subsection{Source Organization}

\code{sbt} inherits the source convention from the \myref{https://maven.apache.org/}{Maven}
build automation tool. Maven also organizes repositories of open-source Java libraries.\footnote{That is
also the place where you downloaded the Chisel library on your first build:
\url{https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/edu.berkeley.cs/chisel3}.}

The root of the project is the project home, which contains \code{build.sbt}.
Optional also a \code{Makefile} for the build process, a README, and a LICENSE file.
Folder \code{src} contains all source code. From there it is split between \code{main},
containing the hardware sources and \code{test} containing testers.
Chisel inherits from Scala, which inherits from Java the organization of source
in \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_package}{packages}.
Packages organize your Chisel code into namespaces. Packages can also contain
sub-packages.
The folder \code{target} contains the class files and other generated files.
I recommend to also use a folder for generated Verilog files, which is usually
call \code{generated}.


To use the facility of namespaces in Chisel, you need to declare that a class/module
is defined in a package, in this example in \code{mypacket}:

\input{code/packet.txt}

\noindent Note that in this example we see the import of the \code{chisel3} packet
to use Chisel classes.

To use the module \code{Abc} in a different context (packet name space),
the components of packet \code{mypacket} need to be imported. The underscore
(\_) acts as wildcard, meaning that all classes of \code{mypacket} are imported.

\input{code/usepacket.txt}

\noindent It is also possible to not import all types from \code{mypacket},
but use the fully qualified name \code{mypack.Abc} to refer to the module
\code{Abc} in packet \code{mypack}.

\input{code/usepacket2.txt}

\noindent It is also possible to import just a single class and create an instance of it:

\input{code/usepacket3.txt}


\subsection{Running sbt}

A Chisel project can be compiled and executed with a simple \code{sbt} command:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt run
\end{verbatim}

This command will compile all your Chisel code from the source tree and searches
for classes that contain an \code{object} that contains a \code{main} method, or simpler
that extends \code{App}. If there is more than one such object, all objects are listed and
can be selected.
You can also directly specify the object that shall be executed as parameter to \code{sbt}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt "runMain mypacket.MyObject"
\end{verbatim}

Per default \code{sbt} searches only the \code{main} part of the source tree and not
the \code{test} part.\footnote{This is a convention form Java/Scala that the test folder contains
unit tests and not objects with a \codefoot{main}.} However, Chisel testers, as described here,
contain a \code{main}, but shall be placed in the \code{test} part of the source tree.
To execute a \code{main} in the tester tree use following \code{sbt} command:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt "test:runMain mypacket.MyTester"
\end{verbatim}

Now that we know the basic structure of a Chisel project and how to compile and run it
with \code{sbt}, we can continue with a simple testing framework.
    
\section{Testing with Chisel}

Tests of hardware designs are usually called \myref{https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx10/isehelp/ise_c_simulation_test_bench.htm}{test benches}.
The test bench instantiates the design under test (DUT), drives input ports, observes output ports,
and compares them with expected values.

Chisel provides test benches in the form of a \code{PeekPokeTester}.
One strength of Chisel is that it can use the full power of Scala to write those
test benches. One can, for example, code the expected functionality of the hardware
in a software simulator and compare the simulation of the hardware with the
software simulation. This method is very efficient when testing an implementation
of a processor~\cite{lipsi:arcs2018}.

To use the \code{PeekPokeTester} following packages need to be imported:

\input{code/test_import.txt}

\noindent Testing a circuit contains (at least) three components: (1) the device under test (often
simply called DUT), (2) the testing logic, also called test bench, and (3) the tester objects
that contains the \code{main} function to start the testing.

The following code shows our simple design under test. It contains to input
ports and one output port, all with a 2-bit width. The circuit does a bit-wise AND
to it returns on the output:

\input{code/test_dut.txt}

\noindent The test bench for this DUT extends \code{PeekPokeTester} and has
the DUT as parameter for the constructor:

\input{code/test_bench_simple.txt}

\noindent A \code{PeekPokeTester} can set input values with \code{poke()} and
read back output values with \code{peek()}. The simulation is advanced with one
step (= one clock cycle) with \code{step(1)}.
We can print the values of the outputs with \code{println()}.

The test is created and run with following tester main:

\input{code/test_main_simple.txt}

\noindent When you run the test, you will see the results printed to the terminal
(besides other information):

\begin{verbatim}
[info] [0.004] SEED 1544207645120
[info] [0.008] Result is: 0
[info] [0.009] Result is: 2
test DeviceUnderTest Success: 0 tests passed in 7 cycles
taking 0.021820 seconds
[info] [0.010] RAN 2 CYCLES PASSED
\end{verbatim}

\noindent We see that 0 AND 1 results in 0; 3 AND 2 results in 2.
Besides manually inspecting printouts, which is a fine starting point, we can also
express our expectations in the test bench itself with \code{expect()},
having the output port and the expected value as parameters.
The following example shows testing with \code{expect()}:

\input{code/test_bench.txt}

\noindent Executing this test does not print out any values from the hardware,
but that all tests passed as all expect values are correct.

\begin{verbatim}
[info] [0.001] SEED 1544208437832
test DeviceUnderTest Success: 2 tests passed in 7 cycles
taking 0.018000 seconds
[info] [0.009] RAN 2 CYCLES PASSED
\end{verbatim}

\noindent A failed test, when either the DUT or the test bench contain an error,
produces an error message describing the difference between the expected and actual
value. In the following we changed the test bench to expect a 4, which is an error:

\begin{verbatim}
[info] [0.002] SEED 1544208642263
[info] [0.011] EXPECT AT 2   io_out got 0 expected 4 FAIL
test DeviceUnderTest Success: 1 tests passed in 7 cycles
taking 0.022101 seconds
[info] [0.012] RAN 2 CYCLES FAILED FIRST AT CYCLE 2
\end{verbatim}

In this section we described the basic testing facility with Chisel for simple tests.
However, in Chisel the full power of Scala is available to write testers.
We will show these possibilities later.

\subsection{ScalaTest}

\myref{http://www.scalatest.org/}{ScalaTest} is a testing tool for Scala (and Java),
which we can use to run Chisel testers.
To use it, include the library in your \code{build.sbt} with following line:

\begin{verbatim}
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.0.5" % "test"
\end{verbatim}

\noindent Tests are usually found in \code{src/test/scala} and can be run with:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt test
\end{verbatim}

\noindent A minimal test (a testing hello world) to just test a Scala Integer
addition:

\input{code/scalatest_hello_world.txt}

\noindent Although Chisel testing is more heavyweight than unit testing of Scala programs,
we can wrap a Chisel test into a ScalaTest class. For the \code{Tester} shown
before this is:

\input{code/scalatest_simple.txt}

The main benefit of this exercise is to be able to run all tests with a simple
\code{sbt test} (instead of a running \code{main}). You can run just a single
test with \code{sbt}, as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt "testOnly SimpleSpec"
\end{verbatim}

\section{Exercises}

For this exercise we will revisit the blinking LED from
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}
and explore the ALU example.

\subsection{A Minimal Project}

First, let us find out what a minimal Chisel project is. Explore the files in the
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/tree/master/hello-world}{Hello World}
example.
The \code{Hello.scala} is the single hardware source file.
It contains the hardware description of the blinking LED (\code{class Hello})
and an \code{App} that generates the Verilog code.

Each file starts with the import of Chisel and related packages:

\input{code/import.txt}

\noindent Then follows the hardware description, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:chisel:hello}.
To generate the Verilog description we need an application. A Scala object that \code{extends APP}
is an application that implicitly generates a main function where the application starts.
The only action of this application is to create a new \code{HelloWorld} object and pass it
to the Chisel driver \code{execute} function. The first argument is an array of Strings,
where build options can be set (e.g., the output folder). The following code will
generate the Verilog file \code{HelloWorld.v}.

\input{code/generate.txt}

\noindent Run the generation of the example manually with

\begin{chisel}
$ sbt "runMain Hello"
\end{chisel}

and explore the generated \code{Hello.v} with an editor. The generated Verilog code may not be
very readable, but we can find out some details. The file starts with a module \code{Hello},
which is the same name as our Chisel module. We can identify our LED port as
\code{output io\_led}. Pin names are the Chisel names with a prepended \code{io\_}.
Besides our LED pin, the module also contains \code{clock} and \code{reset} input signals.
Those two signals are added automatically by Chisel.
Furthermore, we can identify our two register \code{cntReg} and \code{blkReg} definitions.
We may also find the reset and update of those registers at the end of the module definition.
Note, that Chisel generates a synchronous reset.

For \code{sbt} to be able to fetch the correct Scala compiler and the Chisel library
we nee a \code{build.sbt}:

\begin{chisel}
scalaVersion := "2.11.7"

resolvers ++= Seq(
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots"),
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
)

libraryDependencies += "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel3" % "3.1.2"
\end{chisel}

\noindent Note that in this example we have a concrete Chisel version number to avoid checking on
each run for a new version (which will fail if we are not connected to the Internet).
Change the \code{build.sbt} configuration to use the latest Chisel version by changing the
library dependency to

\begin{chisel}
libraryDependencies += "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel3" % "latest.release"
\end{chisel}

\noindent and rerun the build with \code{sbt}. Is there a newer version of Chisel
available and will it be automatically downloaded?

For convenience, the project also contains a \code{Makefile}.
It just contains the \code{sbt} command, so we do not need to remember it and
can simply generate the Verilog code with:

\begin{chisel}
make
\end{chisel}

The project also contains a
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/hello-world/verilog/hello_top.v}{Verilog top level},
which wires the reset signal to 0.
This works for our example in an FPGA, as registers usually power up 0.
Besides a \code{README} file, the example project also contains project
files for different FPGA board. E.g., in
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/tree/master/hello-world/quartus/altde2-115}{quartus/altde2-115} 
you can find the two project files to define a Quartus project for the DE2-115 board.
The main definitions (source files, device, pin assignments) can be found in a plain text file
\myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/hello-world/quartus/altde2-115/hello.qsf}{hello.qsf}.
Explore the file and find out which pins are connected to which signals.
If you need to adapt the project to a different board, there is where the changes are applied.
If you have Quartus installed, open that project, compile with the green \emph{Play} button,
and then configure the FPGA.

Note that the \emph{Hello World} is the very minimal Chisel project.
More realistic projects have their source files organized and contain testers.
The next exercise will explore such a project.

\subsection{A Testing Exercise}

In the last chapter's exercise you have extended the blinking LED example with some input
to build an AND gate and a multiplexer and run this hardware in an FPGA.
We will now use this example and test the functionality with a Chisel tester
to automate testing and also to be independent from an FPGA.
Use your designs from the prior chapter and add a Chisel tester to test the functionality.
Try to enumerate all possible inputs and test the output with \code{except()}.

Testing within Chisel can really speedup the debugging of your design.
However, it is always a good idea to synthesize your design for an FPGA and run tests
with the FPGA. There you can perform a reality check on the size of your design (usually
in LUTs and flip-flops) and your performance of your design in maximum clocking frequency.
As a reference point, a decent pipelined RISC processor may consume about 300
4-bit LUTs and may run around 100~MHz in a low-cost FPGA (Intel Cyclone or
Xilinx Spartan).

\todo{Do we need more details here?}

\subsection{A More Complete Project}


For this exercise we will use the ALU example from \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples}{chisel-examples}.

\todo{This example uses already quite some Scala and the switch statement.
We should probably postpone this for later.}


\chapter{Components}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/components}
  \caption{A design built of a a hierarchy of components.}
  \label{fig:components}
\end{figure}


A larger digital design is structured into a set of components, often in
a hierarchical way. Each component has an interface with input and output
wires, usually called ports. These are similar to input and output pins in an IC.
Components are connected by wiring up the inputs and outputs.
Components may contain subcomponents to build the hierarchy.

Figure~\ref{fig:components} shows an example design. Component C has
two input ports and two output ports. The component itself is assembled out
of two subcomponents: B and C, wich are connected to the inputs and
outputs of C. One output of A is connected to an input of B.
Component D is at the same hierarchy level as component C and connected
to it.

The outermost component, which is connected to physical pins
in a chip, is called the top-level component.

In this chapter we will explain how components are described in Chisel and
provide several examples of standard components.
Those standard components serve two purposes: (1) they provide examples
of Chisel code and (2) they provide a library of components ready to be reused
in your design.

\section{Components in Chisel are Modules}

Hardware components are called modules in Chisel. Each module extends
the class \code{Module} and contains a field \code{io} for the interface.
The interface is defined by a \code{Bundle} that is wrapped into a call to \code{IO()}.
The \code{Bundle} contains fields to represent input and output ports of
the module. The direction is given by wrapping a field into either a call to \code{Input()}
or \code{Output()}. The direction is from the view of the component itself.

The following code shows the definition of the two example components A and B from
Figure~\ref{fig:components}:

\input{code/components_ab.txt}

\noindent Component A has two inputs, named \code{a} and \code{b}, and two
outputs, named \code{x} and \code{y}. For the ports of component B
we chose the names \code{in1}, \code{in2}, and \code{out}.
All ports use an unsigned integer (\code{UInt}) with a bit width of 8.
As this example code is about connecting components and building a
hierarchy, we do not show any implementation within the components.
The implementation of the component is written at the place where
the comments states ``function of X''.
As we have no function associated with those example components,
we used generic port names. For a real design use descriptive
port names, such as \code{data}, \code{valid}, or \code{ready}.

Component C has three input and two output ports. It is built out of
components A and B. We show how A and B are connected to the ports
of C and als the connection between an output port of A and an
input port of B:

\input{code/components_c.txt}

Components are created with \code{new}, e.g., \code{new CompA()}, and need to be wrapped
into a call to \code{Module()}. The reference to that module is stored in a local variable,
in this example \code{val compA = Module(new CompA())}.

With this reference we can access the IO ports by dereferencing the \code{io} field of the module
and the individual fields of the IO \code{Bundle}.

The simplest component in our design has just an input port, named \code{in}, and
an output port, named \code{out}.

\input{code/components_d.txt}

The final missing peace of our example design is the top-level component, which itself
is assembled out of components C and D:

\input{code/components_top.txt}

Good component design is similar to good design of functions or methods in
software design. One of the main questions is how much functionality shall we put into
a component and how large should a component be. The two extremes are very
small components, such an adder, and very large components.

Beginners in hardware design often start with very tiny components.
The problem is that design books use very small components to show the principles.
But the sizes of the examples (in those books, and also in this book) is small
to fit into a page and to not distract by too many details.

The interface to a component is a little bit verbose (with types, names, directions,
IO construction). As a rule of thumb I would propose that the core of the component,
the function, should be at least as long as the interface of the component.

For very small components, such as a counter, Chisel provides a more lightweight
way to describe them as functions that return hardware.


\section{An Arithmetic Logic Unit}

One of the central components for circuits that compute, e.g., a microprocessor, is an
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit}{arithmetic-logic unit},
or ALU for short. Figure~\ref{fig:alu} shows the symbol of an ALU.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/alu}
  \caption{An arithmetic logic unit, or ALU for short.}
  \label{fig:alu}
\end{figure}

The ALU has two data inputs, labeled \code{A} and \code{B} in the figure, one function input \code{fn},
and an output, labeled {Y}. The ALU operates on \code{A} and \code{B} and provides the result
at the output. The input \code{fn} selects the operation on \code{A} and \code{B}.
The operations are usually some arithmetic, such as addition and subtraction, and some logical
functions such as and, or, xor. That's why it is called ALU.

The operation is selected by the function input \code{fn}. The ALU is usually a combinational
circuit without any state elements. An ALU might also have additional outputs to signal properties
of the result, such as zero or the sign.

The following code shows an ALU with 16-bit inputs and outputs that supports: addition, subtraction, or, and and
operation, selected by a 2-bit \code{fn} signal.

\input{code/components_alu.txt}

\noindent In this example we use a new Chisel construct, the \code{switch/is} construct to describe
the table that selects the output of our ALU.
To use this utility function we need to import another Chisel package:

\input{code/components_util.txt}

\section{Lightweight Components with Functions}

Modules are the general way to structure your hardware description.
However, there is some boiler plate when declaring a module and when instantiating and
connecting it.
A lightweight way to structure your hardware is to use functions.
Scala functions can take Chisel (and Scala) parameters and return generated hardware.
As a simple example we generate an adder:

\input{code/components_fn_def.txt}

\noindent We can then create two adders by simply calling the function \code{adder}.

\input{code/components_fn_use.txt}

\noindent Note that this is a \emph{hardware generator}. You are not executing any add operation
during elaboration, but create two adders (hardware instances). The adder example is artificial
to be a simple example. Chisel has already an adder generation function, like \code{+(that: UInt)}.

Functions as lightweight hardware generators can also contain state (including a register).
Following example returns a one clock cycle delay element (a register).

\input{code/components_fn_delay.txt}

\noindent By calling the function with the function itself as parameter, this generated a two
clock cycle delay.

\input{code/components_fn_2delay.txt}

\noindent Again, this is a too short example to be useful, as \code{RegNext()}
already is that function creating the register for the delay.

Functions can be declared as part of a \code{Module}. However, functions that shall be
used in different modules are better placed into a Scala object that just collects utility
functions.

\chapter{Combinational Building Blocks}

In this chapter we explore various combinational circuits, basic building block that we can
use to construct more complex systems.
In principle all combinational circuits can be described with Boolean equations.
However, more often a description in form of a table is more efficient.
We let the synthesize tool extract and minimize the Boolean equations.
Two basic circuits, best described in a table form, are a decoder and an encoder.

\section{Combinational Circuits}

Before describing some standard combinational building blocks, we will explore
how combinational circuits can be expressed in Chisel.
The simplest form is a Boolean expression, which can be assigned a name:

\input{code/comb_bool.txt}

\noindent The Boolean expression is given a name (\code{e}) by assigning it
to a Scala value. The expression can be reused in other expressions:

\input{code/comb_use.txt}

Such an expression is considered fixed. A reassignment to \code{e}
with \code{=} would result in a Scala compiler error: \code{reassignment to val}.
A try with the Chisel operator \code{:=}, as shown below,

\input{code/comb_error.txt}

\noindent results in a runtime exception: \code{Cannot reassign to read-only}.

Chisel also supports describing combinational circuits with conditional updates.
Such a circuit is declared as a \code{Wire} and uses conditional operations,
such as \code{when} to describe the logic of the circuit.
The following code declares a \code{Wire} \code{w} of type \code{UInt} and assigns a default
value of \code{0}. The \code{when} block takes a Chisel \code{Bool} and reassigns
\code{3} to \code{w} if \code{cond} is \code{true.B}.

\input{code/comb_wire.txt}

\noindent The logic of the circuit is a multiplexer, where the two inputs are the constants
\code{0} and \code{3} and the condition \code{cond} the select signal.
Keep in mind that we describe hardware circuits and not a software program with conditional
execution.

The Chisel condition construct \code{when} has also a form of \emph{else}, it is called
\code{otherwise}. With assigning a value under any condition we can omit the default
value assignment:

\input{code/comb_otherwise.txt}

Chisel also supports a chain of conditionals (a if elseif else chain) with \code{.elsewhen}:

\input{code/comb_elsewhen.txt}

Note the `.' in \code{.elsewhen} that is needed to chain methods in Scala.
Those \code{.elsewhen} branches can be arbitrary long.
However, if the chain of conditions depends on a single signal, it is better
to use the \code{switch} statement, which is introduced in the following
subsection with a decoder circuit.

For more complex combinational circuits it might be practical to assign
a default value to a \code{Wire}. This can be combined with the wire
declaration with \code{WireDefault}.\footnote{In the current version of Chisel
it is called WireInit, but will change with the release of Chisel 3.2}


\input{code/comb_wiredefault.txt}

One might question why using \code{when}, \code{.elsewhen}, and \code{otherwise}
when Scala has \code{if}, \code{else if}, and \code{else}? Those statement are for
conditional execution of Scala code, not generating Chisel (multiplexer) hardware.
Those Scala conditionals have their use in Chisel when we write circuit generators,
which take parameters to conditionally generate \emph{different} hardware instances.

\section{Decoder}

A \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decoder}{decoder}
converts a binary number of $n$ bits to an $m$-bit signal, where $m \leq 2^n$.
The output is one-hot encoded (where exactly one bit is one).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/decoder}
  \caption{A 2-bit to 4-bit decoder.}
  \label{fig:decoder}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:decoder} shows a 2-bit to 4-bit decoder. The function of the decoder
can be described in a truth table, such as Table~\ref{tab:decoder}.

\begin{table}
 \centering
 \label{tab:decoder}
  \begin{tabular}{rr}
    \toprule
    a & b \\
    \midrule
    00 & 0001 \\
    01 & 0010 \\
    10 & 0100 \\
    11 & 1000 \\
    \bottomrule 
  \end{tabular} 
  \caption{Truth table for a 2 to 4 decoder.}
\end{table}

The representation of logic as a truth table can be directly described in Chisel with a
\code{switch} based table.
The \code{switch} statement is not part of the core Chisel language.
Therefore, we need to include the elements of the package \code{chisel.util}.

\input{code/encdec_util.txt}

\noindent The following code introduces the \code{switch} statement of Chisel to describe a decoder:

\input{code/encdec_dec.txt}

\noindent The above \code{switch} statement lists all possible values of the \code{sel} signal
and assigns the decoded value to the \code{result} signal.
Note that even if we enumerate all possible input values, Chisel still needs us to assign a
default value, as we do by assigning 0 to \code{result}.
This assignment will never be active and therefore optimized away by the backend tool.
It is intended to avoid situations with incomplete assignments for combinational circuits
(in Chisel a \code{Wire}) that will result in unintended latches in hardware description
languages such as VHDL and Verilog. Chisel does not allow incomplete assignments.

In the example before we used unsigned integers for the signals. A maybe clearer representation
of an encode circuit uses binary notation:

\input{code/encdec_decbin.txt}

A table gives a very readable representation of the decoder function, but is also
a little bit verbose.
When examine the table, we see an regular structure: a 1 is shifted left by the number
represented by \code{sel}. Therefore, we can express a decoder with the Chisel shift
operation \code{<<}.

\input{code/encdec_shift.txt}

Decoders are used as a building block for a multiplexer by using the output as an enable
with an AND gate for the multiplexer data input. However, in Chisel we do not need to construct
a multiplexer, as a \code{Mux} is available in the core library.
Decoders can also be used for address decoding and then the outputs are used as
select signals for e.g., different IO devices connected to a microprocessor. 


\section{Encoder}

An \myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoder_(digital)}{encoder}
converts a one-hot encoded input signal into a binary encoded output signal.
The encoder does the inverse operation of a decoder.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/encoder}
  \caption{A 4-bit to 2-bit encoder.}
  \label{fig:encoder}
\end{figure}


\begin{table}
 \centering
 \label{tab:encoder}
  \begin{tabular}{rr}
    \toprule
    a & b \\
    \midrule
    0001 & 00 \\
    0010 & 01 \\
    0100 & 10 \\
    1000 & 11 \\
    ???? & ?? \\
    \bottomrule 
  \end{tabular} 
  \caption{Truth table for a 4 to 2 encoder.}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:encoder} shows a 4-bit one-hot input to a 2-bit binary output encoder and
Table~\ref{tab:encoder} the truth table of the encode function. However, an encoder will
only work as expected when the input signal is one-hot coded. For all other input values the output
is undefined. As we cannot describe a function with undefined outputs we will use a default
assignment that catches all undefine input patterns.

The following Chisel code assigns a default value of 00 and then uses the switch statement
for the legal input values.

\input{code/encdec_enc.txt}

\section{Exercise}

Describe a combinational circuit to convert a 4-bit binary input to the encoding of a
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display}{7-segment display}.
You can either just define the codes for the decimal digits, which was the initial
usage of a 7-segment display, or additionally define encodings for the remaining bit pattern
to be able to display all 16 values of a single digit in
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal}{hexadecimal}.
When you have an FPGA board with a 7-segment display, connect 4 switches or
buttons to the input of your circuit and the output to the 7-segment display.

\chapter{Sequential Building Blocks}

Sequential circuits a circuits where the output depends on the input \emph{and}
a previous value. As we are interested in synchronous design (clocked designs),
we mean synchronous sequential circuits when we talk about sequential
circuits.\footnote{Sequential circuits can also build with asynchronous logic and
feedback, but this is a specific niche topic and cannot be expressed in Chisel.}

\chapter{Example Components}

In this section we explore some medium sizes digital designs, such as
a FIFO buffer, which are used as building blocks for larger design.
As an example we will design a serial interface (also called UART),
which itself will use the FIFO buffer.

\section{FIFO Buffer}

To decouple a write (sender) and a reader (receiver) some form
of buffering between the writer and the reader is inserted.
A common buffer is a first-in, first-out
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_%28computing_and_electronics%29}{FIFO})
buffer. Figure~\ref{fig:fifo} shows a writer, the FIFO, and a reader.
Data is put into the FIFO by the writer on \code{din} with an active
\code{write} signal. Data is read from the the FIFO by the reader on
\code{dout} with an active \code{read} signal.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=\scale]{figures/fifo}
  \caption{A writer, a FIFO buffer, and a reader.}
  \label{fig:fifo}
\end{figure}

A FIFO is initially empty, singled by the \code{empty} signal. Reading
from an empty FIFO is usually undefined. When data is written and never
read a FIFO will become \code{full}. Writing to a full FIFO is usually ignored
and the data lost. In other words, the signals \code{empty} and \code{full}
serve as handshake signals 

Several different implementations of a FIFO are possible: E.g., using on-chip
memory and read and write pointers or simply a chain of registers with a
tiny state machine. For small buffers (up to tens of elements) a FIFO organized
with individual registers connected into a chain of buffers is a simple and efficient
implementation.

We start by defining the IO signals for the writer and the reader. The size of
the data is configurable with \code{size}.

\begin{chisel}
class WriterIO(size: Int) extends Bundle {
  val din = UInt(INPUT, size)
  val write = Bool(INPUT)
  val full = Bool(OUTPUT)
}

class ReaderIO(size: Int) extends Bundle {
  val dout = UInt(OUTPUT, size)
  val read = Bool(INPUT)
  val empty = Bool(OUTPUT)
}
\end{chisel}

\subsection*{Start on Better Counters}

This is straightforward. However, one might ask if this is the most efficient
implementation of counting. The comparison against an end value, 10 in our
example, involves some combinational circuit in an ASIC. More efficient in an
ASIC (and as well as in loops of software programs) is counting down and exit when 0
is reached.

If we want to count N, we start with N-1 and count till 0.

\todo{down counting code}

With a comparison against 0 we need only a NOR gat to detect the 0 condition.
This optimization is valid for an ASIC, but not for an FPGA based on LUTs.
With comparison using LUTs, there is no difference comparing against a '0' or
'1' bit. In that case, use a better readable counting logic towards the end value.

However, there is still one more trick a clever hardware designer can pull off.
Counting up or down needed a comparison against all counting bis, so far.
What about counting down \emph{one too many}? In that case, the counter
becomes negative. Detecting a negative value is simply comparing the
most significant bit against 'a'.

If we want to count N, we start with N-2 and count till -1.

\todo{Show optimized down counting code.}

\todo{discuss >= and so on}

\chapter{A Processor Design}

As one of the last chapters in this book we present a medium size project:
the design, simulation, and testing of a microprocessor.
In order to keep this project manageable, we will design a simple accumulator
machine.
The processor is called \myref{https://leros-dev.github.io/}{Leros}~\cite{leros:arcs2019}
and is available in open source at \url{https://github.com/leros-dev/leros}.

Leros is designed to be simple, but still a good target for a C compiler.
The description of the instructions fits on one page, see Table~\ref{tab:leros:isa}.
In that table A represents the accumulator, PC is the program counter,
i is an immediate value (0 to 255), Rn a register
n (0 to 255), o a branch offset relative to PC, and AR an address register for memory access.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Opcode & Function & Description\\
\midrule
add & A = A + Rn & Add register Rn to A \\
addi & A = A + i & Add immediate value i to A \\

\section{Start with an ALU}

A central component of a processor is the
\myref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit}{arithmetic logic unit}, or ALU for short.
Therefore, we start with coding of the ALU und a test bench.
First, we define an \code{Enum} to represent the different operations of the ALU:

\input{code/leros_types.txt}

\noindent An ALU has usually two operand inputs (call them \code{a} and \code{b}), an operation \code{op}
(or opcode) input to select the function and an output \code{y}.
Figure~\ref{fig:leros-alu} shows the ALU.

\todo{draw a nice ALU, see Wikipedia}

We first define shorter names for the three inputs. The logic for \code{res} is computed
with a \code{switch} statement. Therefore, it gets a default assignment of 0.
The switch statement enumerates all operations and assigns the expression accordingly.
All operations map directly to a Chisel expression.
At the end we assign the result \code{res} to the ALU output \code{y}

\begin{figure}
\input{code/leros_alu.txt}
\caption{The Leros ALU.}
\label{fig:leros-alu}
\end{figure}

For the testing we write the ALU function in plain Scala, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:leros-alu-scala}.

\begin{figure}
\input{code/leros_alu_ref.txt}
\caption{The Leros ALU function written in Scala.}
\label{fig:leros-alu-scala}
\end{figure}

\noindent While this duplication of hardware written in Chisel by a Scala implementation does not
detect errors in the specification, it is at least some sanity check.
We use some corner case values as test vector:

\input{code/leros_alu_testvec.txt}

\noindent And testing all functions with those values on both inputs:

\input{code/leros_alu_test.txt}

\noindent Full exhaustive testing for 32-bit arguments is not possible, which was the reason we
selected some corner cases as input values. Beside testing against corner cases it is also useful
to test against random inputs:

\input{code/leros_alu_rand.txt}

\noindent The tests can be run within the Leros project with

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt "test:runMain leros.AluTester"
\end{verbatim}

and shall produce a success message similar to:

\begin{verbatim}
[info] [0.001] SEED 1544507337402
test Alu Success: 70567 tests passed in 70572 cycles taking
3.845715 seconds
[info] [3.825] RAN 70567 CYCLES PASSED
\end{verbatim}

\section{Decoding Instructions}

From the ALU we work backwards and implement the instruction decoder.
However, first we define the instruction encoding in its own Scala class and in
a \emph{shared} package. We want to share the encoding constants between
the hardware implementation of Leros, an assembler for Leros, and an instruction
set simulator of Leros.

\input{code/leros_constants.txt}

\todo{Update code when Leros is more complete, as stuff is missing.}

\noindent For the decode component we define a \code{Bundle} for the output,
which is later fed partially into the ALU.

\input{code/leros_decode_bundle.txt}

\noindent Decode takes as input an 8-bit opcode and delivers the decoded signals
as output. Those driving signals are assigned a default value with \code{WireInit}.

\input{code/leros_decode_init.txt}

\noindent The decoding itself is just a large switch statement on part of the
instruction that represents the opcode (in Leros for most instructions the upper
8 bits.)

\input{code/leros_decode.txt}

\section{Assembling Instructions}

To write programs for Leros we need an assembler. However, for the very first
test we can hard code a few instructions, and put them into a Scala array,
which we will use to initialize the instruction memory.

\input{code/leros_asm_hard.txt}

\noindent However, this is a very inefficient approach to test a processor.
Writing an assembler with an expressive language like Scala is not a big project.
Therefore, we write a simple assembler for Leros, which is possible within about
100 lines of code. We define a function \code{getProgram} that calls the assembler.
For branch destinations we need a symbol table, which we collect in a \code{Map}.
A classic assembler runs in two passes: (1) collect the values for the symbol table
and (2) assemble the program with the symbols collected in the first pass.
Therefore, we call assemble twice with a parameter to indicate which pass it is.

\input{code/leros_asm_call.txt}

The \code{assemble} function starts with reading in the source
file\footnote{This function does not actually read the source file, but for this
discussion we can consider it as the reading function.}
and defining two helper functions to parse the two possible operands: (1) an
integer constant (allowing decimal or hexadecimal notation) and (2) to read
a register number.

\input{code/leros_asm_start.txt}

Figure~\ref{fig:leros-asm-match} shows the core of the assembler for Leros.
The core of the assembly function is covered by a Scala \code{match}
expression. \todo{Some more words on the code.}



\begin{figure}[t]
\input{code/leros_asm_match.txt}
\caption{The main part of the Leros assembler.}
\label{fig:leros-asm-match}
\end{figure}

\section{Exercise}

This last chapter exercise assignment is in a very free form. You are at the end
of your learning tour through Chisel and ready to tackle design problems that
you find interesting.

One option is to read the chapter again and read along all the source code in the
\myref{https://github.com/leros-dev/leros}{Leros repository}, run the test cases,
fiddle with the code by breaking it and see that tests fail.

Another option is to simply write your own implementation of Leros.
The implementation in the repository is just one possible organization of a pipeline.
You could write a Chisel simulation version of Leros with just a single pipeline stage,
or go creasy and superpipeline Leros for the highest possible clocking frequency.

A third option is to design you own processor from scratch. Maybe the demonstration
how to build the Leros processor and the needed tools has convinced you that processor
design and implementation is no magic art, but engineering that can be very joyful.

\chapter{Contributing to Chisel}

Chisel is an open-source project under constant development and improvement.
Therefore, you can also contribute to the project. Here we describe how to
setup your environment for Chisel library development and how to contribute
to Chisel.

\section{Setup the Development Environment}

Chisel consists of several different repositories, all hosted at
the \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject}{freechips organization at GitHub}.

Fork the repository, which you like to contribute, into your personal GitHub account.
This can be easily done by pressing the \code{Fork} button in the GitHub web interface.
Then from that fork, clone your fork of the repository. In our example we will change
\code{chisel3} and the clone command for my local fork is:

\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone git@github.com:schoeberl/chisel3.git
\end{verbatim}

To compile Chisel 3 and publish as a local library execute:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd chisel3
$ sbt compile
$ sbt publishLocal
\end{verbatim}

Watch out during the publish local command for the version string of the published
library, which contains the string \code{SNAPSHOT}.
If you use the tester and the published version is not compatible with the Chisel
SNAPSHOT, fork and clone the \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-testers}{chisel-tester}
repo as well and publish it local.

To test your changes in Chisel, you probably also want to setup a Chisel project,
e.g., by forking/cloning an \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-empty}{empty Chisel project},
renaming it, and removing the \code{.git} folder from it.

Change the \code{build.sbt} to reference the locally published version of Chisel.
Furthermore, at the time of this writing, the head of Chisel source uses Scala 2.12, but Scala
2.12 has troubles with
\myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-template/issues/35}{anonymous bundles}.
Therefore, you need to add following Scala option: \code{"-Xsource:2.11"}.
The \code{build.sbt} should look similar to:

\begin{verbatim}
scalaVersion := "2.12.6"

scalacOptions := Seq("-Xsource:2.11")

resolvers ++= Seq(
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots"),
  Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
)

libraryDependencies +=
  "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel3" % "3.2-SNAPSHOT"
libraryDependencies +=
  "edu.berkeley.cs" %% "chisel-iotesters" % "1.3-SNAPSHOT"
\end{verbatim}

Compile your Chisel test application and take a close look if it picks up the local published
version of the Chisel library (there is also a SNAPSHOT version published, so if, e.g.,
the Scala version is different between your Chisel library and your application code,
it will pickup the SNAPSHOT version from the server instead of your local published
library.)

See also \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3\#for-chisel-developers}{some notes
at the Chisel repo}.

\section{Testing}

\todo{I need more details here from the Chisel developers on what and how
to test.}

When you change the Chisel library you should run the Chisel tests.
In an \code{sbt} based project, this is usually run with:

\begin{verbatim}
$ sbt test
\end{verbatim}

Furthermore, if you add functionality to Chisel you should also provide tests for the
new features.

\section{Contribute with a Pull Request}

In the Chisel project no developer commits directly to the main repository.
A contribution is organized via a
\myref{https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/}{pull request}
from a branch in a forked version of library.
For further information see the documentation at GitHub on
\myref{https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/}{collaboration with
pull requests}.
The Chisel group started to document
\myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-lang-governance/blob/master/reviewer_guidelines.md}{contribution
guide lines}.

\section{Exercise}

Invent a new operator for the \code{UInt} type, implement it in the Chisel library,
and write some usage/test code to explore the operator. It does not need to be
a very useful operator, just anything, e.g., a ? operator that delivers the lefthand side
if it is different from 0 otherwise the righthand side. Sounds like a multiplexer, right?
How many lines of code did you need to add?\footnote{A quick a dirty implementation
needs just two lines of Scala code.}

As simple as this was, please be not tempted to fork the Chisel project and
add you little extensions. Changes and extension shall be coordinated with the
main developers.
This was just a simple exercise to get you started.

If you are getting bold, you could pick one of the
\myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/issues}{open issues} and try to solve it.
Then contribute with a pull request to Chisel.
However, probably first watch the style of development in Chisel by watching the GitHub
repositories.
See how changes and pull requests are handled in the Chisel open-source project.



\chapter{Chisel 2}

This book covers version 3 of Chisel. And Chisel 3 is recommended for new designs.
However, there is still Chisel 2 code out in the wild, which has not yet been converted
to Chisel 3. There is documentation available how to convert a Chisel 2 project to
Chisel 3:

\begin{itemize}
\item \myref{https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/wiki/Chisel3-vs-Chisel2}{Chisel2 vs. Chisel3} and
\item \myref{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples/blob/master/TowardsChisel3.md}{Towards Chisel 3}
\end{itemize}

However, you might get involved in a project that still uses Chisel 2,
e.g., the \myref{https://github.com/t-crest/patmos}{Patmos}~\cite{patmos:rts2018} processor.
Therefore, we will provide here some information on Chisel 2 coding for those who
have started with Chisel 3.

First, all documentation on Chisel 2 has been removed from the web sites
belonging to Chisel. We have rescued those PDF documents and put them
on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel2-doc}.
You can use the Chisel 2 tutorial by switching to the Chisel 2 branch:

\begin{chisel}
$ git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-tutorial.git
$ cd chisel-tutorial
$ git checkout chisel2
\end{chisel}

The main visible difference between Chisel 3 and 2 are: the definitions of
constants, bundles for IO, wires, memories, and probably older forms of register
definitions.

Chisel 2 constructs can be used, to some extend, in a Chisel 3 project by
using the compatibility layer using as package \code{Chisel} instead of \code{chisel3}.
However, using this compatibility layer should only be used in a transition phase.
Therefore, we will not cover it here.

Here are two examples of basic components, the same that have been presented
for Chisel 3. A module containing combinational logic:

\lstinputlisting[language=chisel]{chisel2/src/main/scala/Logic.scala}

Note that the \code{Bundle} for the the IO definition is \emph{not} wrapped into
an \code{IO()} class.  Furthermore, the direction of the different IO ports is defined
as part of type definition, in this example as \code{INPUT} and \code{OUTPUT}
as part of \code{UInt}. The width is given as the second parameter.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
The 8-bit register example in Chisel 2:

\lstinputlisting[language=chisel]{chisel2/src/main/scala/Register.scala}
\end{minipage}

Here you see a typical register definition with a reset value passed in as
an \code{UInt} to the named parameter \code{init}. This form is still valid in Chisel 3,
but usage of \code{RegInit} and \code{RegNext} is recommended for new Chisel 3 designs.
Note also here the constant definition of an 8-bit wide 0 as \code{UInt(0, 8)}.

Chisel based testing and Verilog code is generated by calling \code{chiselMainTest}
and \code{chiselMain}. Both ``main'' functions take a \code{String} array for further parameters.

\lstinputlisting[language=chisel]{chisel2/src/main/scala/LogicTester.scala}

\lstinputlisting[language=chisel]{chisel2/src/main/scala/LogicHardware.scala}

A memory with sequential registered read and write ports is defined in Chisel 2 as:

\begin{chisel}
  val mem = Mem(UInt(width = 8), 256, seqRead = true)
  val rdData = mem(Reg(next = rdAddr))
  when(wrEna) {
    mem(wrAddr) := wrData
  }
\end{chisel}

\section{Minor Pitfalls}

How to define a 32 bit unsigned constant of 0xffffffff?

Comparing a 32-bit UInt against a large literal results in error message.

val x = UInt(32.W)
when (x === 0xFFFFFFFF.U) {
...
}


0xffffffff.U does not work, as Int is a signed integer and the value is -1.

solutions are BigInt or Strings:

From email: However! You can do this with either a String or a BigInt. I think both of the following work:

val x = UInt(32.W)
when (x === "hffffffff".U || x === BigInt("ffffffff", 16)) {
  \\...
}

from Richard: 
You can also use a long, 0xffffffffL.U, though this will break at 64 bits.
For the String-to-UInt conversion, x also works as a hex radix specifier, eg "xffffffff".U

\todo{Make an example and explain.}

\subsection*{Course Abstract}

Chisel is a hardware construction language implemented as a domain specific language in Scala. Therefore, the full power of a modern programming language is available to describe hardware and, more important, hardware generators. Chisel has been developed at UC Berkeley and successfully used for several tape outs of RISC-V. Here at DTU we used Chisel in the T-CREST project and in teaching advanced computer architecture.

In this course I will give an overview of Chisel to describe circuits at the RTL, how to use the Chisel tester functionality to test and simulate digital circuits, present how to synthesize circuits for an FPGA, and present advanced functionality of Chisel for the description of circuit generators. Besides lecturing we will have lab sessions to describe small circuits and evaluate them in an FPGA.

The aim of the course is to get a basic understanding of a modern hardware description language and be able to describe simple circuits in Chisel. This course shall give a basis to explore more advanced concepts of circuit generators written in Chisel/Scala.
