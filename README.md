# Digital Design with Chisel

![Book Cover](cover-small.jpg)

This book is an introduction to digital system design using a modern hardware
construction language, Chisel.
In this book we focus on a slightly higher abstraction level to get you up to
speed to build more complex, interacting digital systems.

A compiled PDF version of the book is available at the wiki pages of this project:
[Digital Design with Chisel](https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-book/wiki/chisel-book.pdf).

This book project has an accompanying repository containing
[Chisel examples](https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples).
