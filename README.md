# Digital Design with Chisel

This book is an introduction to digital system design using a modern hardware
construction language, Chisel.
In this book we focus on a slightly higher abstraction level to get you up to
speed to build more complex, interacting digital systems.

A compiled PDF version of the book is available at the wiki pages of this project
at https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-book/wiki

This book project has an accompanying repository containing
[Chisel examples](https://github.com/schoeberl/chisel-examples).

A very much work in progress.
